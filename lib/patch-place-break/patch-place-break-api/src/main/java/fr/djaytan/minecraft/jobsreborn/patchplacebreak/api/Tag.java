/**
 * This class represents a place-and-break tag for the patch. The purpose of this tag is to be
 * attached to the metadata of a block.
 *
 * <p>When an instance of this class is found in the metadata of a given block, this means that the
 * patch must be applied for eligible {@link PatchActionType}.
 * See {@link PatchPlaceBreakApi#isPlaceAndBreakAction(PatchActionType, TagLocation)} for
 * more details about it.
 *
 * <p>This tag contains the following information:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The initial date-time of when the tag as been created ;
 *   <li>The validity duration of the tag. If null, this means that the tag isn't an "ephemeral" one
 *       and will be persisted forever until removed explicitly from metadata of block (e.g. by
 *       calling {@link PatchPlaceBreakApi#removeTag(TagLocation)}).
 * </ul>
 *
 * This class is thread-safe and immutable.
