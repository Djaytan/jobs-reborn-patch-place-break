/**
 * This interface represents the API to apply place-and-break patch.
 *
 * <p>The patch of JobsReborn plugin works as follows: when an eligible event occurs
 * (e.g. a block place), a tag is attached to the block in order to cancel future jobs rewards
 * (payments, experience and points) when breaking this non-naturally placed block (e.g. preventing
 * diamond ores place-and-break exploit). This will be applied for {@link PatchActionType#BREAK} and
 * {@link PatchActionType#TNTBREAK} jobs actions.
 *
 * <p><i>Note: block placed by plugins aren't tagged too.</i>
 *
 * <p>It can work in the reverse order: when breaking a block, an "ephemeral" tag is placed to the
 * newly "placed" AIR block. It permits to cancel jobs rewards when placing another block in a
 * short-time delay (e.g. prevent sapling place-and-break exploit). This will be applied for
 * {@link PatchActionType#PLACE} jobs actions.
 *
 * <p>Nevertheless, an attached tag can be removed given specific conditions like when a block grow
 * event happens. This will permit farmers to achieve their job without seeing their action being
 * cancelled by this patch plugin. This is the purpose of the {@link #removeTag(TagLocation)}
 * method.
 *
 * <p>A tag can be placed with {@link #putTag(TagLocation, boolean)} method. The
 * {@link #putBackTagOnMovedBlocks(List, TagVector)} has a special purpose: to permit to put back tags
 * when blocks are moved (e.g. by block piston extend and retract events).
 *
 * <p>Finally, this controller give the possibility to check if the jobs ActionType involving a
 * given Block is a place-and-break exploit or no with the method
 * {@link #isPlaceAndBreakAction(PatchActionType, TagLocation)}.
 *
