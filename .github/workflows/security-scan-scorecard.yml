# All release branches are supposed to follow SemVer convention while being restricted
# to only the major.minor part.
# Filtering performed based on recommended RegEx from semver.org:
# https://semver.org/#is-there-a-suggested-regular-expression-regex-to-check-a-semver-string
# The pattern has been adapted since workflow syntax doesn't support RegEx.
