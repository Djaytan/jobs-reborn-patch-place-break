# All release branches are supposed to follow SemVer convention while being restricted
# to only the major.minor part.
# Filtering performed based on recommended RegEx from semver.org:
# https://semver.org/#is-there-a-suggested-regular-expression-regex-to-check-a-semver-string
# The pattern has been adapted since workflow syntax doesn't support RegEx.
on:
  # It is assumed that every commit pushed into release branches has been validated by the CI first:
  # whether at PR level or when pushing to the default branch (i.e. main)

  # For this workflow, the following assumptions have been made and thus should be reality:
  # * The Git repository is a Java project
  # * Git tags are supposed to be the source of truth regarding the latest existing version
  #   of the Git repository.
  # * The application version is managed by Maven and is located under the pom.xml file(s)
  #   (multi-module is supported)
  # * The version-maven-plugin has been declared in the root pom.xml file
  # * Release branches follow the format 'release/v<major>.<minor>' (SemVer compliant)
  #
  # Vision:
  # This workflow has been designed for continuous delivery, meaning that every change dispatch
  # the delivering of a new release which then can be directly promoted to PRD / published
  # if all checks pass.
  # Thus, this workflow allows delivering potentially multiple releases in a day in a safe
  # and secure way.
  #
  # Project setup recommendations:
  # * The version located in the pom.xml file must be 'DEV-SNAPSHOT'
  # * Release branches should only diverge from the default one
  # * Any commit made at release branch level must be made at default branch level as well
  #   (except if otherwise required)
  # * Branches following 'github-actions/auto-release-*' format should be protected
  #   (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
  #   * The options 'Lock branch' and 'Do not allow bypassing the above settings' should be ticked
  # * Tags following 'v*.*.*' format should be protected
  #   (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-tag-protection-rules)
  #   and managed exclusively by the workflow (i.e. not create/changed by a user except if
  #   he knows exactly what he is doing!)
  #
  # Usages:
  # * When needing to perform a minor or major version bump: simply create a new release branch
  # * When needing to perform a patch version bump: simply add a new commit to existing release branch
  #
  # Limitations:
  # * alpha, beta and release candidates (RC) versions are not supported
  #
  # Perspectives:
  # * The approach is generic enough to be easily re-exploited for other languages
  #   and build tools (e.g. JavaScript/TypeScript, Java with Gradle, ...)
