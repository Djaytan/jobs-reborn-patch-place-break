/**
 * This interface represents the API to apply place-and-break patch.
 *
 * <p>The patch of JobsReborn plugin works as follows: when an eligible event occurs (e.g. {@link
 * org.bukkit.event.block.BlockPlaceEvent}), a tag with key {@link
 * #PLAYER_BLOCK_PLACED_METADATA_KEY} is attached to the block in order to cancel future jobs
 * rewards (payments, experience and points) when breaking this non-naturally placed block (e.g.
 * preventing diamond ores place-and-break exploit). This will be applied for {@link
 * ActionType#BREAK} & {@link ActionType#TNTBREAK} jobs actions.
 *
 * <p><i>Note: block placed by plugins aren't tagged too.</i>
 *
 * <p>It can work in the reverse order: when breaking a block, an "ephemeral" tag is placed to the
 * newly "placed" {@link org.bukkit.Material#AIR} block. It permits to cancel jobs rewards when
 * placing another block in a short-time delay (e.g. prevent sapling place-and-break exploit). This
 * will be applied for {@link ActionType#PLACE} jobs actions.
 *
 * <p>Nevertheless, an attached tag can be removed given specific conditions like when an {@link
 * org.bukkit.event.block.BlockGrowEvent} happens. This will permit farmers to achieve their job
 * without seeing their action being cancelled by this patch plugin. This is the purpose of the
 * {@link #removeTag(Block)} method.
 *
 * <p>A tag can be placed with {@link #putTag(Block, boolean)} and {@link #putTagOnNextTick(Block,
 * boolean)} methods. The use of the second one is useful when there is the need to wait the end of
 * a processing event (e.g. {@link org.bukkit.event.block.BlockBreakEvent}). The {@link
 * #putBackTagOnMovedBlocks(List, Vector)} has a special purpose: to permit to put back tags when
 * blocks are moved (e.g. {@link org.bukkit.event.block.BlockPistonExtendEvent} & {@link
 * org.bukkit.event.block.BlockPistonRetractEvent}).
 *
 * <p>Finally, this controller give the possibility to check if the jobs ActionType involving a
 * given Block is a place-and-break exploit or no with the method {@link
 * #isPlaceAndBreakAction(ActionType, Block)}.
