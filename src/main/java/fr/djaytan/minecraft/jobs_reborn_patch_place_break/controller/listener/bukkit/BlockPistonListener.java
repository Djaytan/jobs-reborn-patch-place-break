 * This class represents a {@link org.bukkit.event.block.BlockPistonEvent} listener. More

 * BlockPistonRetractEvent}.
 *
 * <p>The purpose of these listeners are to prevent the piston exploit which can be a way to remove
 * a place-and-break patch tag and this isn't what we want. So, the idea is simply to move tags in
 * the same direction as the moved blocks.
