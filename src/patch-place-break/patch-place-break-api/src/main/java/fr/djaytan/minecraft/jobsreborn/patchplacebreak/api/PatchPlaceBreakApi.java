/**
 * This interface represents the API to apply place-and-break patch.
 *
 * <p>The patch of JobsReborn plugin works as follows: when an eligible event occurs (e.g. a block
 * place), a tag is attached to the block in order to cancel future jobs rewards (payments,
 * experience and points) when breaking this non-naturally placed block (e.g. preventing diamond
 * ores place-and-break exploit). This will be applied for {@link BlockActionType#BREAK} and {@link
 * BlockActionType#TNTBREAK} jobs actions.
 *
 * <p>It can work in the reverse order: when breaking a block, an "ephemeral" tag is placed to the
 * newly "placed" AIR block. It permits to cancel jobs rewards when placing another block in a
 * short-time delay (e.g. prevent sapling place-and-break exploit). This will be applied for {@link
 * BlockActionType#PLACE} jobs actions.
 *
 * <p>Nevertheless, an attached tag can be removed given specific conditions like when a block grow
 * event happens. This will permit farmers to achieve their job without seeing their action being
 * cancelled by this patch plugin. This is the purpose of the {@link #removeTags(BlockLocation)}
 * method.
 *
 * <p>A tag can be placed with {@link #putTag(BlockLocation, boolean)} method. The {@link
 * #moveTags(Collection, Vector)} has a special purpose: to permit to put back tags when blocks are
 * moved (e.g. by block piston extend and retract events).
 *
 * <p>Finally, this API give the possibility to check if the jobs action type involving a given
 * block is a place-and-break exploit or no with the method {@link
 * #isPlaceAndBreakExploit(BlockActionType, BlockLocation)}.
